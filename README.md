## Instructions
In one terminal, run the server Python file.
In another terminal, run the client Python file.
Add more terminals running the client Python files to add more users.

## Major Issues
Initially wrote the client side to be Java, but this caused a lot of bugs with the threads. We just switched it it Python which instantly solved all issues.
